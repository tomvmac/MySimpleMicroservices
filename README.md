# MySimpleMicroservices
Summary:

MySimpleMicroservices is a high level microservices project that illustrates a simple microservices architecture using the following technologies:

1. Spring Boot
2. Docker
3. Kubernetes

There are two services in this project.  One is myhello and the other is mygreeting.  See the individual ReadMe.txt files in each of the projects for details.

Basically when the user invokes a url on myhello, it will perform an API call to mygreeting to fetch data.
